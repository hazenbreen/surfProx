# surfProx
Project to show you howler you are from the surf.

SurfProx will let you pick a quality of wave (Poor, Fair, Good, etc.) and will tell you the closest location with that quality of surf.

Alternatively, you can use SurfProx to set a distance (in miles or time driving) that you are willing to travel, and SurfProx will return the best break to go to for that range.

SurfProx will run as a website (locally at first) and will run using Surfline's API.
